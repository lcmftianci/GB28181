Oct 2015    : 5.0.0 and later
	This file is not maintained. oSIP is stil under dev. Keep looking
	at the git on http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=osip and ChangeLog.

Apr 2003    : 2.0.0
	oSIP is becoming oSIP2. In fact, this new version is very close
	to the previous one but the API has been completely renamed in
	order to be more consistent. Source and include files have also
	been renamed to be more consistent and make oSIP more readable.

Jul 2002    : 0.8.8
	I have never tested the windows version myself. In fact, previous
	version	was broken du to a wrong contribution. This is now fixed
	by using a new thread API (which Microsoft recommends to not use!).
	Aside to this, this new revision is fully tested on a wide variety
	of OS and several bugs and race conditions has been fixed.

Feb 2002    : 0.8.1
	Old API for fsm is broken. The finite state machines have been
	entirely rewritten to be compliant with rfc2543bis-07. They
	only contains what's defined for the TRANSACTION LAYER. Previously,
	the finite state machines were only usable by endpoints. Now,
	the UAS_UAC_core is removed from the finite state machines so
	they can be used by Proxy_core as well as UAS_UAC_core as
	defined by rfc2543bis-07.

Jan 2002    : 0.8.0
	The library now contains a full SDP parser and
	its accessor API. The ./fsm also includes a new
	(and optionnal) framework to be used for automatic
	SDP negociation. This feature is targetted to SIP UA.

Sept 2001   : 0.7.0
	2 libraries are provided by now: the SIP parser
	and the state machines.
	Also, osip can now be compiled without any thread,
	mutex, and semaphore support.
	The API (parser and fsm) is now entirely fixed.

Aug 2001    : 0.6.2
	finite state machine has been optimized. Note
	that it may not be free of bug as it has not been
	tested heavily. This release also include many
	improvements.

Aug 2001    : 0.6.1
        move some prototypes, correct BUGs, and began
        the declaration of the accessor API.

Aug 2001    : 0.6.0
	This release has a completely NEW PARSER which is
	a lot more compliant with draft-sip-rfc2543-03.txt.
	The API for the parser is completely new and
	ready for a better error management. The support
	of multiple attachments (MIME) has been added.

May/June 2001: 0.5.1 to 0.5.4
	Those versions include some bug fixes but no major
	improvements.

April 2001   : first release of oSIP 0.5.0
	This is the first release and is not complete but
	yet usable to implement SIP agents.
