       History:
       =======

The oSIP stack project has been started in September 2000
since the early days of the SIP protocol.

The initial version was quite close to the actual one in
terms of features. The SIP parser and the SIP state machines
were already provided. At this point and till version 0.9.7,
the API was not very clean but osip was already stable,
portable, flexible and compliant with SIP.

After rfc2543 were released, a lot of developments were made
to follow the drafts that were produced prior to the final
release of rfc3261. (around version 0.8.X).

A lot of users were requesting help on the API and were
reporting their difficulties to use it. I have decided
to refine osip into a new osip2 version which would offer
a simpler and nicer API. With a very few exception, only
the API has been changed between 0.9.7 and 2.0.0. From
this version, osip has been much readable.

However, oSIP is still complex to use. There are reasons
for that. oSIP was made to be flexible (which make the API
quite large). oSIP is architecture free (but you need to
understand how it works to use it correctly). oSIP is
implementing only low layers of SIP (so you still can
build malformed messages, or uncompliant ones). oSIP will
not warn you about most errors that you can make.

Be aware, that if you use osip, you still have to read
carefully the rfc. oSIP is not easy to use, but I'm
convinced there are benefits in terms of flexibility.
If you find osip too complex to use, please look for
another adequate solution. -eXosip2 is the first one
to look at!-
