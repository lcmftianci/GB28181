       Downloading:
       ===========

If you want the latest version, you can use the CVS:

  $> git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/osip.git
  $> ./autogen.sh
     
    Note that you must have libtool, autoconf & automake to be able
    to run the autogen.sh script.

If you have downloaded the archive, run the following command instead:

  $> tar -xvzf libosip2-X.X.X.tar.gz


       Compilation:
       ===========

As usual, run the following on unix platforms:

  $> ./configure 
  $> make
  # make install

A specific README located in the "./help" directory exists
for each supported platforms. This is the definitive place
to find informations about specific platforms.

Note that osip is developped on a i386 linux and other architecture
might be broken. Reports if one appears broken.

A nice way would also be:

  $> tar -xvzf libosip-0.X.X.tar.gz
  $> mkdir linux-build
  $> cd linux-build
  $> ../libosip-0.X.X/configure
  $> make
  # make install

Here is a list of options you can give to the 'configure' command line:

configure --disable-mt             ==> disable any thread support,
flags: "-DOSIP_MONOTHREAD"

configure --disable-debug          ==> disable debug.

configure --disable-trace          ==> disable the trace in the logfile.
flags: "-UENABLE_TRACE"

configure --prefix=/your/local     ==> install in '$prefix' (default is /usr/local)
