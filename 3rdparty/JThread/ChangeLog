			 	    ---------

 1.3.3 (March 2017)
 	* Fixed race conditions when starting the same thread from
	  two different threads, or when starting and killing a
	  thread at the same time. Thanks to Andreas Ringlstetter for
	  providing the patch.

 1.3.2 (March 2017)
	* CMake tests if pthread_cancel exists (doesn't on Android)
	* Added CMake option to compile only a static version of the
	  library (useful for PNaCl)
	* JThread::IsSameThread was added by by isage.dna@gmail.com

 1.3.1 (November 2011)
 	* Fixed a bug in the CMake configuration: was unable to handle
	  path names with spaces.
	* In an MS-Windows environment, you can now choose to build a
	  DLL instead of a static library.

 1.3.0 (July 2011)
 	* Switched to CMake
	* Added namespace 'jthread'

 1.2.1 (June 2006)
 	* In the pthread implementation the thread is now created in the
	  detached state. This makes sure the resources of a thread are
	  freed when the thread ends. Thanks to Julien Künzi 
	  (julien.kuenzi@epfl.ch) for bringing this to my attention.

 1.2.0 (March 2006)
 	* Added JMutexAutoLock class. Thanks to Jeremy Noring 
	  (jnoring@wilife.com) for suggesting this.
	* On MS-Windows platforms, you now have the choice between two
	  mutex implementations. Besides the implementation present in
	  previous releases, you can now also use a CRITICAL_SECTION
	  object. This was suggested by Jeremy Noring (jnoring@wilife.com).
	* Added pkg-config stuff. Thanks to Philippe Khalaf 
	  (burger@speedy.org) for supplying the patches.

 1.1.2 (September 2005)
 	* Win32 version now uses _beginthreadex instead of CreateThread.
	  This should be a safer function. Thanks to Zhu Jin Hong
	  (labile@21cn.com) for pointing this out.
	* Added WinCE support.
	* Switched to automake.

 1.1.1 (December 2004)
 	* Added necessary 'CloseHandle' calls for the thread handle in 
	  the Win32 version of 'jthread.cpp'. Thanks to Nils O. Selasdal
	  (NOS@Utel.no) for pointing out the handle leak.

 1.1.0 (September 2004)
 	* Important change: In your own void *Thread() function, you
	  now have to call JThread::ThreadStarted() at the start of
	  the function. Until this function is called, the Start()
	  function blocks. This way, when the Start() function is
	  finished, we can be really really sure that our own thread
	  is running.

 1.0.1 (August 2004)
 	* configure now detects pdflatex and listings package: 
	  only if these are found, documentation is built.

 1.0.0 (February 2001)
 	* Initial release
	* Thanks to Stijn Vansummeren (stijnvs@lumumba.luc.ac.be) for fixing
	  a bug in the JThread::GetReturnValue() function
