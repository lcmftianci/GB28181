/**
 * Helper class for several RTPTransmitter instances, to be able to cancel a
 * call to 'select', 'poll' or 'WSAPoll'.
 *
 * This is a helper class for several RTPTransmitter instances. Typically a
 * call to 'select' (or 'poll' or 'WSAPoll', depending on the platform) is used
 * to wait for incoming data for a certain time. To be able to cancel this wait
 * from another thread, this class provides a socket descriptor that's compatible
 * with e.g. the 'select' call, and to which data can be sent using
 * RTPAbortDescriptors::SendAbortSignal. If the descriptor is included in the
 * 'select' call, the function will detect incoming data and the function stops
 * waiting for incoming data.
 *
 * The class can be useful in case you'd like to create an implementation which
 * uses a single poll thread for several RTPSession and RTPTransmitter instances.
 * This idea is further illustrated in `example8.cpp`.
